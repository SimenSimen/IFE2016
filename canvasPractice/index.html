        <p>Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring</p>
        <p>My summer wine is really made from all these things</p>
        <p>I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to</p>
        <p>A song that I had only sang to just a few</p>
        <p>She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time</p>
        <p>And I will give to you summer wine</p>
        <p>Ohh-oh-oh summer wine</p>
        <p>Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring</p>
        <p>My summer wine is really made from all these things</p>
        <p>Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time</p>
        <p>And I will give to you summer wine</p>
        <p>Mmm-mm summer wine</p>
        <p>My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak</p>
        <p>I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet</p>
        <p>She reassured me with an unfamiliar line</p>
        <p>And then she gave to me more summer wine</p>
        <p id="test">Mmm-mm summer wine</p>
        <p>Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring</p>
        <p>My summer wine is really made from all these things</p>
        <p>Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time</p>
        <p>And I will give to you summer wine</p>
        <p>Mmm-mm summer wine</p>
        <p>When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes</p>
        <p>My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size</p>
        <p>She took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime</p>
        <p>And left me cravin' for more summer wine</p>
        <p>Ohh-oh-oh summer wine</p>
        <p>Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring</p>
        <p>My summer wine is really made from all these things</p>
        <p>Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time</p>
        <p>And I will give to you summer wine</p>
        <p>Mmm-mm summer wine...</p>
